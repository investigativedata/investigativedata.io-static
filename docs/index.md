# Aleph

## Managed by investigativedata.io

[investigativedata.io](https://investigativedata.io) is an agency that provides infrastructure, data catalogs and service know-how to support investigative journalism and research organizations.

One of our main services is "**Managed Aleph**", an *exclusive and dedicated* [Aleph](https://Alephdata.org) instance for newsrooms and related organizations.

### Secure hosting available

Together with our partner [flokinet.is](https://flokinet.is) we are offering as well secure hosting solutions for Aleph. [Find out more](https://aleph.run)

## Why "Managed Aleph"

> [Aleph](https://docs.aleph.occrp.org/) is a powerful tool for people who follow the money. It helps investigators to securely access and search large amounts of data - no matter whether they are a government database or a leaked email archive. Aleph is developed and maintained by the [Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP)](https://occrp.org) and a growing open source community (of which [investigativedata.io](https://github.com/investigativedata/) is part of).

Aleph is mostly known for the [public instance run by OCCRP](https://aleph.occrp.org). But it is as well a software that any organization can run internally. This enables an investigative boost for research teams:

- Upload documents to a secure space only your team has access to
- Cross-reference documents with structured data such as company registries or [sanctions lists](https://www.opensanctions.org/)
- Build a knowledge graph about all of your investigative data over time
- Build an extensive archive of all your organizations research material
- Find connections in historic and current material to gain new leads

With a **Managed Aleph**, everything related to server setup, security and backups is handled by us. You don't have to worry about anything at all â€“ just investigate!

## Consulting

If you are running your own instance of Aleph (or plan to run it), we provide consulting on any matter, from setting up a secure infrastructure, handling authentication, migrating and importing data into Aleph, or including Aleph into a research workflow.

## Data wrangling

We do all kinds of data work, from harvesting source data, scraping public datasets, leak discovery, cleaning & import, and structured mapping from sources to the [data model](https://followthemoney.tech) of Aleph. An example for useful datasets is the project [investigraph.eu](https://investigraph.eu).
