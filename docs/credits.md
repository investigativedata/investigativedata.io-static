Aleph is developed by the [Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP)](https://occrp.org) and released with an [open source (MIT license)](https://github.com/alephdata/aleph/).

We especially thank [Friedrich Lindenberg](https://pudo.org/) for creating Aleph in the first place, his tireless advice and pushing the idea of "Aleph as a service".
